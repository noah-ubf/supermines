Advanced minesweeper-like game with a lot of options

Intentionally made as a one solid file, including images.

History of development:

* I was bored so I played an online minesweeper game. Often I was irritated with the mines set in the corners. So I decided to make my own version with an option to deny setting mines in corners.

* When I archieved that a new idea stroke me: what if the cells are not squares but hexagonal or rectangular? Would it impact the gameplay (later I realized that it would). The code was organized in the way that only a minimal part had to be rewritten for different cell forms.

* After the thing had been done there still was one problem: the game takes time to play it. And I added an AI (not really, but a robot) to play the game instead of me. Now you can play the game in one click and save a lot of time:)

* The Robot can not only win instead of you but it can also lose instead of you! That makes me believe it's a real AI :)  (When it's impossible to calculate a safe hit it can hit randomly if such option is checked)

* I tryed to make the code more or less organized in modules so it could be easily navigated and modified.

* If God gives me more free time I'ld like to add some comments to make the code more understandable :)

God bless you!
